# Overlooked basics

(learn all the implementations of common datastructures in python)

* Know all methods of list very well, it is circular and linked


# Data Structures

* Collections
* List
* Set
* Dictionary



# Misc

* Zip
* itertools (very powerful and useful)
  - Combinations
  - Permutations
  - chain

* lambda, map and list comprehensions and which to really use
* fstring
* Generators for saving memory and time (only suitable for certain situations)
* understanding and using [callable operators](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/operators/#callables-operators)



# Tricks:

* transposing a matrix 
```
mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
zip(*mat)
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]

```

* Iterate With enumerate() Instead of range()

* Debug With breakpoint() Instead of print()

* When using a set, rather than making a list and converting to a set, start by taking an empty set and directly add data to the set
