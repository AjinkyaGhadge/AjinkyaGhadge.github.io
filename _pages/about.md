## Summary

I am a Graduate student at the College of Computing and Informatics, University of Massachussets-Amherst. I've taken courses focusing on Software Development and Data Science. I am enrolled to the Data Science Track of the CS program. I have worked for two-years, before starting my graduate studies. Please do check the projects that I've worked on recently in the projects section of my website.

## Work Experience

I worked as a Software Engineer at Persistent Systems. I worked closely with a ForEx Company supporting their high-volume transactional system and developing/maintaining the backend services. 

I also worked at Research Centre Imarat( part of Defense Research and Development Organization), as a Software Developer in a research project on a contractual basis. Despite the contractual nature, my motivation to work in applied research and serve my country made me sign up for the position. I wore multiple-hats, and worked on creation of datasets( annotation, compression, cleaning), creating machine learning models and maintaining workstation systems for development. I also worked to build software componenets for teams working on embedded platforms for data collection and machine learning inferencing.

## More about me!

Often, I like to work on some personal projects, often building things from first principles. When lost in deep-though I write poetry(in Hindi and English), some of which you can find on my medium blog. I am game for a jamming session as a vocalist or a guitarist, and have put a few of my songs on soundcloud. To keep in shape, I do run, I like smaller but intense runs of 5-10k(follow me on Strava!) and High-Intensity Interval Training.
