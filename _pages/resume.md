TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE
Projects
```
- **Event stream processing to find and explain anamolous behavior in Hadoop cluster** (Jan 2020 – April 2020)
    - Implemented Complex Event Processing to determine events causing **cluster imbalance, bottlenecks and faults**
    by analysis of data generated in **hadoop** cluster logs for 3 **different** workloads
    - Transformed **logs to** 1200 + **attributes** time-series data to implement algorithm determining the cluster faults
    and reduced number of attributes for faulty explanation by 90.5 **%** , reducing fault detection time
- **Dataset generation pipeline from raw data for Machine learning Inference** (March 2018 – July 2019 )
    - Applied threaded polling and memory mapping to improve image frame capture to 200 + frames per seconds
    - Implemented python script to generate **~** 10 **TB of Infrared and RGB image datasets** using multiprocessing and
    binary threshold
    - Built **RESTful Web Application** using the Python-Flask framework for deploying machine learning model
- **Scenery classification using TF-IDF, Scene Parsing and Natural Language Processing** (Oct 2019 – Dec 2019)
    - Compared information retrieval methods, word embeddings, and Neural networks for mapping correlation
    between object labels and scenes for refining classification accuracy of scenes by 82 **%**
