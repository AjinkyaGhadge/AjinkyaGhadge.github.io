# Refresher

* Each object is an instance of a class.
* data members and member functions
* OOPs design allows us to think from behaviour point of view
* Object Oriented Design Goals:
  1. Robustness
    - handle various unexpected inputs, types
    - handle load (eg, high volume of data)
    - edge conditions
  2. Adaptibility
    - handle change for environments
    - correct faults
    - improve performance
  3. Reusability

* Object Oriented Design Principles:
  1. Modularity
  2. Abstraction
  3. Encapsulation

* Essential Software Development Principles for Python
  1. Classes - CamelCase
  2. Functions - all small and use underscore instead of space
  3. constant should be written as all capital MAX, MIN
