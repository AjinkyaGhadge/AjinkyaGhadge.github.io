# Elegant, minimal and Feature rich presentation using Jupyter Notebook

**Create minimal presentations with embedded code that you can run-edit during the presentation**

1. [Install Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id4), along with its pre-requisites. *You might want to use the alternative for experienced Python users: Installing with pip*

2. [Install RISE](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/installation.html)

You can find the instructions to run the program in the documentation, very neatly done by the author.

Now, that RISE is setup, you will be able to make awesome presentations using Python.

**Bonus:**

*Not just Python, you can probably run all supported Jupyter Kernels*

[Install Jupyter Matlab](http://am111.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jmatlab_install.html)

There are many kernels available and you can make really beautiful presentations. Some unique advantages are that 

1. Using markdown latex for formulae.

2. Directly use existing markdown documentation.

3. Run Python functions, for example you can use python based GUI, which can be triggered from the notebooks.

I doubt if you will use any other presentation tool
